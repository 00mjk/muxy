## Middleware
##
## Middleware are plugins that are given the opportunity to intervene
## before a request is dispatched to the proxied system (PRE_DISPATCH event)
## and afterwards (POST_DISPATCH event). They are given a reference to
## the current context (HTTP Context or []bytes) and can mutate them.
##
## Middleware are executed in the order specified in this config.
