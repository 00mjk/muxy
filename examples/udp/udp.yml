name: UDP Tampering Example

## Test Description. Used for reporting
description: Tamper with UDP messages

## Specify log output level
##
## Log Levels supported:
## Trace (0), Debug (1), Info (2, Default), Warn (3), Error (4), Fatal (5)
loglevel: 1

## Configure a proxy that will handle your requests, and forward
## to proxied host.
##
## Currently supports `tcp_proxy` and `http_proxy`.
proxy:

  # Configures a UDP proxy
  #
  # NOTE: TLS is currently not supported
  - name: udp_proxy
    config:
      host: 0.0.0.0           # Local address to bind to and accept connections. May be an IP/hostname
      port: 53              # Local port to bind to
      proxy_host: 192.168.65.1     # Proxy server port
      proxy_port: 53        # Proxied server port
      packet_size: 64         # Size of each contiguous network packet to proxy

## Middleware
##
## Middleware are plugins that are given the opportunity to intervene
## before a request is dispatched to the proxied system (PRE_DISPATCH event)
## and afterwards (POST_DISPATCH event). They are given a reference to
## the current context (HTTP Context or []bytes) and can mutate them.
##
## Middleware are executed in the order specified in this config.
